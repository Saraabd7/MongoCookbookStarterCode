This cookbook was created in the aim of creating an image with MongoDB installed on it.

- This cookbook installs MongoDB from the source.

- It creates its apt package and then installs it.

- The recipe also creates the config files and the service file with dynamic input of variables.

### What is Chef
Chef is a declarative configuration management and automation platform used to manages the infrastructure by writing code rather than using a manual process so it enables organisations or individuals to generate a process with better testing, efficient and predictable deployments, centralised versioning, and reproducible environments across all your servers.

Moreover, Chef supports multiple platforms like Windows, Ubuntu, Centos, and Solaris etc. It can also be integrated with cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Open Stack etc.

This cookbook was created in the aim of creating an image with MongoDB installed on it.


When creating a new Chef cookbook, it will automatically create certain directories and files. Then it will be apple to adding your custom files on top these default files and directories. For every chef cookbook you create, you‚Äôll see 8 directories and 3 files under the top-level for that particular cookbook.


## MongoCookbookStarterCode
This cookbook was created using chef¬†generate cookbook MongoCookbookStarterCode¬†to have mongo installed. It also contains a Berksfile which has the chef supermarket and the metadata and is used to manage the dependencies of the cookbook and a berks-cookbooks¬†berks vendor. It also has a attributes default to have 0.0.0.0 and port 27017.
